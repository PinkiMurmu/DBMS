Q. What do you understand by the term SQL ?

  -SQL stands for Structured Query Language .
  -It uses tables in the form of rows and columns to store data .
  -SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases .
  -SQL lets you access and manipulate databases .

SQL is not like other coding languages we learnt so far, it is a database management system. 
It uses queries to make, delete or performing anything on databases and tables. 

In SQL tables are also known as relations.
Rows are often called as tuples and columns are called as attributes.

SQL is a non-case sensitive language .
SQL is a data definition and data manipulation language .
Data store, data retrive, data manipulate . - Relational data .
Which means whether you are writing the syntax in capital or small doesn't matter. 
But the names of tables or columns you need to take care of, whatever way you are writing at first write in that form only.
The characters and varchar should be written inside single-colon or double-colon.

It is really fun to learn new things when you understand those.

Datatypes of the inputs in the tables contains char( which wastes the unused memory of the defined size), varchar (which uses memory as needed), int , float , double, boolean, date, year .
This also contains signed( negative or ppositive) , unsigned (only positive and increased range)

 Types of SQL commands:
  DDL: Create, alter, drop
  DQL: select
  DML: insert, update, delete

Columns are said to be keys:
  1. Primary key
  2. Foreign key
