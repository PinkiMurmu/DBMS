DBMS stands for Database Management System.

It further can be divided into two categories:
    i) Database
          a) Structured (Relation - RDBMS)
          b) unstructured
    ii) DBMS (operations)
      - SQL
      - Oracle
      - MySQL

Advantages of DBMS over File system :
  Searching is efficient .
  Attributes (meta data) don't need .  // meta data - data about data 
  Concurrency in data (multiple people can access the data at the same time)
  Security
  Redundancy (Duplicacy)

We use 3-tire architecture nowadays (Client layer/interface , Business layer , Data Source)
    Scalability and Security are good .

Schema (structure) - Logical representation of data .
