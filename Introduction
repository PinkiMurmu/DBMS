DBMS stands for Database Management System.
Database is a collection of related data in a format theat can be easily accessed(Digital) .
A software application used to manage our DB is called DBMS .

It further can be divided into two categories:
    i) Database
          a) Structured (Relational - RDBMS) data stored in tables(MySQL) .
                    - Non-relational -> data not stored in tables(mongoDB) .
          b) unstructured
    ii) DBMS (operations)
      - SQL
      - Oracle
      - MySQL

Advantages of DBMS over File system :
  Searching is efficient .
  Attributes (meta data) don't need .  // meta data - data about data 
  Concurrency in data (multiple people can access the data at the same time)
  Security
  Redundancy (Duplicacy)

We use 3-tire architecture nowadays (Client layer/interface , Business layer , Data Source)
    Scalability and Security are good .
Schema (structure) - Logical representation of data .

We are using Mysql for data base management .
